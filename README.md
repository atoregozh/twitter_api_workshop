_Getting tweets based on a list of users_

Learn basic building blocks of accessing Twitter API and save returned data from usersâ€™ Twitter account to SQLite database. As you go through the tutorial, you will also learn some important concepts related to scripting in Python that will help you become more comfortable with the language.</p>
*Prereqs*  
1. [Have a text editor] (http://codekitchen.mit.edu/tutorials/text-editors/)  
2. [Skim this tutorial on basic command line commands] (https://gist.github.com/bengolder/7997954)

*Workshop Materials*  
[Access slides here] ("http://web.mit.edu/aizhan/www/twitter_api_workshop/#/). The slides are self-explanatory and are set up such that you can go over them at your own pace without much supervision from anyone. You might encounter some 3rd party bugs along the way or some tough moments if your laptop is running on Windows OS, [read about all of that here] (http://codekitchen.mit.edu/?p=169)

*How to tweak the script?*  
This tutorial gave you a good foundation on how Twitter API works. You might now want to adapt the script given in the workshop for your own needs! How to do it? [Read more here!] (a href="http://codekitchen.mit.edu/?p=175). I'm discussing how to change the script from getting tweets by the list of user to search for any word or combination of words in a tweet (hashtags,twitter handles included).
